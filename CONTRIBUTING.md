## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Plazen itself.

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the existing issues as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an enhancement to an existing one, please open an issue to discuss it. This allows us to coordinate our efforts and prevent duplication of work.
