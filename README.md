## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.18 or later)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm
- A Supabase account and a new project created.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/plazen.git](https://github.com/your-username/plazen.git)
cd plazen
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables. You can find the Supabase URL and Anon Key in your Supabase project's API settings.

```env
# Supabase Project URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL

# Supabase Anon Key (public)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

# Database connection string (from Supabase project settings)
DATABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING

# Your local development URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Important:** Your `DATABASE_URL` should point to your Supabase PostgreSQL database. You can find this in your Supabase project under `Settings` > `Database`. Make sure to add your password to the connection string.

### 4. Set Up the Database

Push the Prisma schema to your Supabase database. This will create the necessary tables (`tasks`, `UserSettings`, etc.).

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can now sign up and start using the application.
